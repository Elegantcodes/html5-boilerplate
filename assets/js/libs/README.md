Some libraries that ship with paulirish/html5-boilerplate have been removed because we don't often need them. However, if you do find a need for them, use them. They're great!

- jQuery, obviously. We've removed jQuery because the environments we work in often provide it by default.
- respond.js for Media Queries. We don't use Media Queries all the time, but respond.js is a fast way to get them working across browsers http://github.com/scottjehl/respond
